See our explainer notebook [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TSandfeld/02805_imdb.github.io/blob/gh-pages/Assignment%20B.ipynb).

## Introduction
IMDb is the worlds biggest online movie database, launched back in 1990. According to Wikipedia[^wiki] IMDb contains more than 3.9 million movie/tv-show titles and 7.4 million personalities. It is with this data that we will try to discover some patterns and the relationship between the best critically acclaimed and highest grossing movie of all time.

### Our data
Though IMDb has millions of titles for us to play around with we don't have to computing power/time to go through all that data. So instead we are going to use a little less data - about 4000 titles with all the relevant attributes such as cast, director, year, budget, worldwide gross, genres, etc. Should you be interested in our datasets, then please see the see [Download Dataset](#download-sets) in the end
