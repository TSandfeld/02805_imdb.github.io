# IMDb Network and Text Analysis
### By Thomas Sandfeld Nielsen & Lennart Pedersen

See our explainer notebook [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TSandfeld/02805_imdb.github.io/blob/gh-pages/Assignment%20B.ipynb).

## Introduction
IMDb is the worlds biggest online movie database, launched back in 1990. According to Wikipedia[^wiki] IMDb contains more than 3.9 million movie/tv-show titles and 7.4 million personalities. With this data we will try to uncover some patterns and relationships between the best critically acclaimed and highest grossing movies of all time. We will use techniques from the world of network-, text- and data analysis to accomplish this

Though IMDb has millions of titles for us to play around with we don't have to computing power/time to go through all that data. So instead we are going to use a little less data - just under 5000 titles with all the relevant attributes such as cast, director, year, budget, worldwide gross, genres, etc. Should you be interested in working with our datasets, then please see the see [Download Dataset](#download-sets) in the end.

## Data analysis
Right away we can start analysing some basic stuff about our datasets. One aspect of IMDb is the **IMDb Rating** which is a numeric scale from 1-10 to judge the quality of the movie. The ratings are generated by registered users of the site.
